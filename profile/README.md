## Project Information

Project SHIELD uses innovative multiplex immunoassays and AI for comprehensive early detection and monitoring of high-risk individuals with pancreatic cancer, ensuring strong ethics, privacy, and regulatory compliance through expert oversight.

SHIELD is developing a simple, affordable blood test to detect pancreatic cancer at its earliest, most treatable stage. By identifying and testing people with elevated genetic risk, SHIELD aims to reduce late-stage diagnoses and increase Europe’s five-year survival rate from under 10% today to 30% by 2035.
